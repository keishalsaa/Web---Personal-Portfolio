# Web---Personal-Portfolio
This website serves as my personal portfolio, created to fulfill an academic assignment. It focuses on the utilization of HTML and CSS, with an emphasis on Flexbox for responsive design. Through this project, I aim to showcase my skills and creativity as I continue to develop my expertise in web development.
